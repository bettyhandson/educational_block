working on blockchain fix project
🧱 Blockchain Fix
Blockchain Fix is a blockchain-based solution designed to identify, diagnose, and resolve issues in decentralized systems — such as transaction errors, smart contract bugs, and network synchronization problems. The project aims to make blockchain maintenance and debugging easier, faster, and more reliable.

🚀 Features


🔍 Blockchain Health Scanner — Scans nodes and smart contracts for common errors or vulnerabilities.


🧠 Automated Issue Detection — Uses pattern recognition to flag potential blockchain inconsistencies.


🧩 Smart Contract Debugging Tools — Provides diagnostic data and suggested fixes for common Solidity or chain-specific issues.


🔗 Multi-Chain Compatibility — Supports Ethereum, Polygon, and other EVM-compatible networks.


🧾 Transaction Validation — Checks transaction integrity and ensures proper propagation across nodes.

Would you like me to tailor it for a specific blockchain framework (e.g., Ethereum + Hardhat, or Hyperledger, or a Python-based chain tool)? That way I can include accurate installation commands and examples.
